This repository is my first foray into the MERN stack coming from ASP.NET Core as a way to quickly understand the workflow of a JavaScript dominated tech stack.

## Features
  -Calendar events with a title, date, start and end times can be added, viewed, edited and deleted.  
  -Events persist on a database and utilize a backend API.  
  -Event creation and editing is validated on the frontend and provides user feedback if invalid.  
  -Months can be cycled through and events translate to the correct calendar box.
  
 ## Tech Stack
  -Node.js on the back end handling startup and managing middleware.  
  -Express used for API routing.
  -MongoDB for storing and modifying events through the Express API.  
  -React for the frontend logic including conditional rendering and connecting to the Express API.
